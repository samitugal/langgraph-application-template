# AI-Powered Knowledge Graph and Question Answering System

## Why it is needed

In today's information-rich world, efficiently organizing, understanding, and retrieving knowledge is crucial. This AI-Powered Knowledge Graph and Question Answering System addresses several key challenges:

1. **Information Overload**: With the vast amount of textual data available, it's challenging to quickly grasp the key concepts and relationships within a body of text. This system automatically extracts and visualizes this information as a knowledge graph.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: Traditional keyword-based search often lacks context. By representing information as a graph, this system captures the relationships between entities, enabling more nuanced and context-aware querying.

3. **Flexible Knowledge Base**: The system can continuously expand its knowledge graph with new information, making it adaptable to various domains and evolving knowledge landscapes.

4. **Intelligent Question Answering**: By combining the power of large language models with structured knowledge graphs, the system can provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries.

5. **Bridging Structured and Unstructured Data**: This system seamlessly integrates unstructured text data with structured graph representations, offering the benefits of both worlds.

6. **Visual Insight**: The graph visualization component allows users to intuitively explore complex relationships within the data, facilitating better understanding and decision-making.

7. **Extensibility**: With its modular architecture, the system can be easily extended to incorporate new data sources, language models, or specialized domain knowledge.

By addressing these needs, this system serves as a powerful tool for researchers, analysts, educators, and anyone dealing with large volumes of textual information, helping them to quickly extract insights, answer questions, and discover new connections within their data.

- **NetworkX and Pyvis**: For graph visualization.
- **Docker**: For containerization and easy deployment.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

1. **LLM Pipeline**: Handles interactions with language models (OpenAI GPT or Amazon Bedrock).
2. **Graph Database**: Manages the Neo4j database operations.
3. **Content Provider**: Supplies text content for knowledge graph generation.
4. **Workflow Nodes**: Individual processing steps in the application workflow.
5. **API and UI**: FastAPI for backend services and Streamlit for the user interface.

## Key Components

### LLM Pipeline

The LLM pipeline (`src/LLM/Pipeline.py`) is responsible for:
- Generating knowledge graph queries
- Routing user requests
- Answering questions based on graph content
- Generating responses for web search results

### Graph Database

The graph database component (`src/Databases/GraphDatabase.py` and `src/Databases/Neo4j.py`) handles:
- Executing Cypher queries
- Fetching graph data
- Managing database connections

### Workflow

The main workflow (`src/graph.py`) orchestrates the entire process, including:
- Routing user input
- Generating knowledge graphs
- Finding relevant nodes
- Answering questions or performing web searches

Here's a visual representation of the workflow:

### UI

The Streamlit-based UI (`src/ui.py`) provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.

## Configuration

The project uses YAML configuration files for both the LLM and database settings:
- LLM config: `configs/LLM/openai.yaml` or `configs/LLM/bedrock.yaml`
- Database config: `configs/GraphDatabase/neo4j.yaml`

## Setup and Running

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
   ```

4. Build and run the containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. Access the Streamlit UI at `http://localhost:8501`

### Manual Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file.

3. Run the Streamlit UI:
   ```
   streamlit run src/ui.py
   ```

## Future Improvements

- Implement caching for improved performance
- Add support for more LLM providers
- Enhance the graph visualization capabilities
- Implement user authentication and multi-user support
- Monitoring and logging

## Environment Variables

The project requires certain environment variables to be set in a `.env` file in the root directory. The required variables differ slightly depending on whether you're using OpenAI or AWS (Bedrock) as your LLM provider.

### For OpenAI Configuration:

- `LLM_CONFIG_PATH=configs/LLM/openai.yaml`
- `GRAPH_DATABASE_CONNECTION_PATH=configs/GraphDatabase/neo4j.yaml`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key`
- `TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key`

### For AWS (Bedrock) Configuration:

- `LLM_CONFIG_PATH=configs/LLM/bedrock.yaml`
- `GRAPH_DATABASE_CONNECTION_PATH=configs/GraphDatabase/neo4j.yaml`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key`
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your_aws_region`
- `TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key`

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and credentials. Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control.

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can interact with the system through the Streamlit UI or by using the API directly.

### Using the Streamlit UI

1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run src/ui.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. You'll see a text input area where you can enter your text or question.

4. For generating a knowledge graph:
   - Enter a paragraph or article of text.
   - Click the "Run" button.
   - The system will generate a knowledge graph and display it visually.

5. For asking questions:
   - Enter your question in the text area.
   - Click the "Run" button.
   - The system will attempt to answer based on the existing knowledge graph.
   - If the answer isn't found in the graph, it will perform a web search.

### Example Workflow

1. Generate a knowledge graph:
   - Input: "John is a student at MIT. He is studying computer science and is passionate about artificial intelligence."
   - The system will create nodes for John, MIT, computer science, and artificial intelligence, with appropriate relationships.

2. Ask a question:
   - Input: "What is John studying?"
   - The system will query the knowledge graph and respond with "John is studying computer science."

3. Ask a question not in the graph:
   - Input: "What is the capital of France?"
   - The system will perform a web search and provide an answer based on the search results.
